This repo is dedicated to an exploratory data analysis project on Broadway shows and was created by Cooper Orio and Aylmer Liang. The main project and the data source is in [this quarto book](https://aylmergit.github.io/Broadway/).

The main chapters of our Quarto book are in the following files in the same order:
  index.qmd
  data.qmd
  results.qmd
  d3graph.qmd
  conclusion.qmd

With the exception of our d3 graph, all the data for our graphs was stored in the Raw_Data folder. For our d3 graph we created an R file to parse the data we needed and converted it into a JSON file for the javascript portion of the d3 graph. All of the d3 files are located in the scripts folder.
