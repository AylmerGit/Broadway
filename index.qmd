# Introduction
The Broadway industry is a cornerstone of live entertainment, renowned for its artistic performances and creative experience. The industry has continually adapted and evolved in response to a changing world. Through this exploratory data analysis project, we hope to better understand the financial trends of plays, musicals, and other live shows playing on Broadway. In particular, we are interested in seeing which shows have historically performed the best, which theatres have held such profitable shows, and what the difference in financial performance of musicals compared to plays and other show types is. In seeking to answer these questions, we also take a glimpse into how revenue and attendance numbers are related, as well as several possible explanations for why musicals seem to be more profitable than plays in general. That being said, analysis and exploration is not necessarily confined to the aforementioned questions, as we find unique quirks about the data that lead to some deeper dives into topics such as location transfers, and the urge to take a look at sales by theatre more intimately.
